Keywords: Weather forecasting, Regression, weather analysis, supervised learning

Description: In this project, weather data near the phoenix airport is analyzed in order to evaluate how temperatures are increasing adversly every year. The reason to choose the data near Phoenix Airport, is because airports consists advanced sensors, which can measure weather accurately. Phoenix is already known for it's extreme hotness. Due to the global warming, temperatures have been changing rapidly. Thereby, predicting weather in advance can help the Government to provide relief measures to underprivileged people from extreme heatwaves and all.
   
Research Questions: 
-> RO1: To describe the trends within data about the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded in the Phoenix region.
-> RO2: To predict the value of the temperature recorded on a particular date in future by using the past weather data in the Phoenix Region.
-> RO3: To defend the model for performing the prediction of weather in RO2
-> RO4: To defend the model for performing the prediction of weather in RO2 and to evaluate causal relationships between the weather and issues like droughts, poor air quality, green house emissions..etc implied by the RO2 model.

Intellectual Merit: This project can provide scope for discovering some new knowledge by studying the change or increase in temperatures in the Phoenix region. This increase in temperatures in the phoenix region can be studied to know the root-cause for this issue like droughts, poor air quality, more green house gas emissions..etc. Therefore, by correlating the temperatures predicted with these issues( droughts, green house emissions..etc), effective measures can be taken.

Data Sourcing: Data source for this project is "NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information)", link for the site is "https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/", this is one of the most reliable government data sources for any type of environmental data.
